Forward Rendering is the usual type of rendering technique that most engines use. Forward rendering starts with supplying the graphics card to the geometry which then gets projected and broken down to vertices, then it gets transformed or split into fragments, which then gets rendered and then passed onto the screen.

Deffered Rendering is when the rendering is deffered a little bit until all of the geometries have been passed down the pipe. The final image is then made by applying the shading at the end.
